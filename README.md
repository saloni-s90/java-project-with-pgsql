# java-project Electronic Management System

The main goal of this project is to manage the records of products, customer as well as employee. This project is standalone (only for admin purpose) software. Electronic Management Project is platform Independent i.e. it can run on any operating system. I have done this project on Linux using java (swing,awt) at frontend, pgpsql(database) at backend and on windows I have used java(swing,awt) for frontend , Mysql(database) at backend. 
Admin can perform operations such as add,edit(update), delete particual record. It is best project for basic undersind of java as well as database management
